# Updating ndev.t3code

The app you use and the server running your agents can be on different machines.
When a server is behind your web or desktop app, an update notice appears in the
conversation and **Settings → Connections**. Update the machine named in that
notice.

## Before you update

Server updates restart the connection and can interrupt active agents and
terminal commands. Saved threads, settings, and project files remain.

**Settings → General → Continue threads after restarts** is off by default.
Enable it to resume supported active threads after an update, crash, or machine
restart. Changes are saved to connected environments that support this setting;
update older servers first. If a supported environment was offline or has a
different value, use **Apply to all** in Settings after it connects.
T3 Code must start again on that machine;
the setting does not enable automatic startup. Terminal commands may still be
interrupted, and threads without saved provider resume state need a new message.
If you previously enabled continuation for updates, enable this setting once
to allow recovery without a connected client.

Updates from the previous orchestration system preserve conversation transcripts but cannot carry
every kind of runtime history forward. Read [Threads from older T3 Code versions](./thread-migration.md)
before continuing an important older thread.

## When versions don't match

A client and server must speak the same orchestration protocol. If they do not, the connection is
refused rather than running half-upgraded:

- An app newer than the server is blocked before connecting, with a notice telling you to update
  T3 Code on the machine named in the notice.
- A server newer than your app refuses the connection with an update message.

Update the side the notice names, then reconnect.

## Update a connected server

The offered action depends on how the server runs:

| Action                     | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update server**          | Keep the client open while it installs and reconnects. Supported background services update remotely. For a desktop-hosted server, this also closes and relaunches the desktop app on the host. |
| **Update the desktop app** | Update the desktop app on the machine running the server, then reopen it if needed.                                                                                                             |
| **Copy update command**    | Stop the command-line server on its host and relaunch with the copied command, keeping your usual startup options.                                                                              |

On the host, run:

```sh
t3 update <client-version>
```

Replace `<client-version>` with the version shown in the notice. The command
asks before restarting the background service; if you decline, run
`t3 service restart` when you are ready. For a server you started by hand,
stop it and start it again afterwards with your usual options such as `--host`
or `--tailscale-serve`.

If you run the server with `npx` rather than an installed `t3`, there is
nothing to update on the host: stop the server and relaunch it as
`npx t3@<client-version>` with the same subcommand and options.

## If an update fails

Keep the client open until it reconnects or reports a failure. A failed service
update can roll back to the previous version. If the update still fails:

1. Retry the offered action once.
2. Check that you updated the server's machine, not only the device you are using.
3. For a command-line server, stop it and relaunch the exact version shown in the notice.

## Updating the fork from upstream nightly

The ndev.t3code macOS app updates from its own source checkout instead of a
download feed. When the latest upstream T3 Code nightly is newer than your
checkout, the update button and **Settings → General → About** offer
**Sync & Build** and name that nightly's version.

**Sync & Build** merges the nightly into your fork, builds the app on this Mac,
then pushes the merge to your fork. Your fork's changes are kept. Conflicts
caused only by the ndev.t3code product rename are resolved for you; anything
else stops the update and lists the conflicted files. Then **Restart &
Install** replaces the installed app with the new build.

The update refuses to start while the checkout has uncommitted changes, is
not on `main`, or is in the middle of another merge. If it stops on conflicts
or the build fails, the checkout is left as it was before the update. Merge
the named nightly by hand, push it, and run **Sync & Build** again.

## Update providers

**Settings → Providers** shows provider updates for the selected environment.
**Update all** updates every outdated provider on every connected environment
at once. Hover it to see which providers it will update. Providers that only
offer a manual update command are not included.

## Mobile updates

To update an environment from your phone, open **Settings → Environments** and
select it. **Check for updates** finds the latest release on that environment's
current release channel. Keep the app open while the environment updates and
reconnects. Hosts that cannot update remotely show instructions for updating on
the machine instead.

The same page lets you refresh provider status and update supported providers.
These controls require a connected environment and permission to operate it.
Provider update checks and restart continuation preferences are in
**Settings → Maintenance**. If provider update checks are disabled, enable them
there before refreshing to find newer versions.

Install App Store or Google Play releases as usual. The mobile app can also
download updates in the background and apply them when you next leave the app.
It saves drafts and queued messages before restarting. If you keep the app open
for a long time, it may ask to install immediately; choosing **Later** leaves the
update queued for the next suitable moment.
